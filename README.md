# ðŸŽ¸ MidiHero
Transform your GuitarHero controller into a rockin' 5-pin MIDI controller for synths, man!

## ðŸŽ¶ Overview
This groovy repo provides the Arduino code and docs you need to turn a 6-button, PS3-gen GuitarHero controller into a rad MIDI controller. The modded axe sends MIDI notes through a 5-pin MIDI output, making it jam with any standard synth.

## ðŸŽ¸ Guitar Components
* `Note buttons` (6 buttons on the neck, dude!)
* `Up/down trigger`
* `Shift button`
* `Directional pad (D-pad)`
* Scale indicator LEDs (lights up your fretboard!)

## ðŸ¤˜ Usage Instructions
### Playing Notes
To shred a note, press and hold one or more `note buttons` and hit that `up/down trigger`. The note will sustain as long as you hold the button, just like a real guitar, bro! Strum the trigger in both directions to play some wicked fast licks.

### Preset Selection
Your guitar comes preloaded with four sick presets:
1. C major scale (C, D, E, F, G, A) - the happy one!
2. E minor pentatonic (E, G, A, Bb, D) - unleash your inner rock god!
3. C major pentatonic (C, D, E, G, A, C) - jam on this groovy scale!
4. C minor chord on top three notes, G minor chord on bottom three - get ready to riff!

The active preset shines bright with one of the four LEDs. Change presets by pressing the `D-pad up/down`.

### Tremolo Functionality
Rock that `tremolo arm`! By default, it'll bend your pitch down by one semitone at full extension. You can adjust the bend range from -12 to 12 semitones, bending notes up or down by up to an octave! To change the range, press the `Shift button` while moving the `D-pad left/right`. Navigate the modes and watch for a flash of all LEDs to know you've made the switch. If no flash, you've hit the end of the list - just go the other way, man!

Tremolo modes include:
* **Pitch** - Pitch bends down or up by semitones based on tremolo range, adjustable with `Shift + left/right`.
* **Aftertouch** - Sends aftertouch (velocity) messages to modify current notes. With a synth like the Arturia MicroFreak, you can control anything through the modulation matrix - let your creativity flow!

### Guitar Tuning
Wanna tweak your presets? No problem, dude! Select a preset, then press and hold the `notes` you want to change. Adjust the pitch with `Shift + D-pad up/down` for a semitone up or down. Transpose an entire preset by holding all notes and pressing `Shift + D-pad up/down`. Just remember, custom presets won't be saved when you restart the guitar - they'll go back to default. But hey, it's a great way to reset if things get funky!

### MIDI Channel Selection
By default, your guitar sends notes on MIDI channel 1. We recommend setting your synth to accept all MIDI notes - check the settings! But if you need a specific channel, press the `D-pad` down and use the `up/down trigger` to change the channel. The active channel is shown in binary with flashing LEDs, from Channel 1 (1000) to Channel 15 (1111), and Channel 16 (0000). Rock on!
